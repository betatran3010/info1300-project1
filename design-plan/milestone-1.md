   **Audience**: I think this site is designed for employers interested in hiring UX designers. 
   
   **Goals of the audience**: They want to look closely at her past projects and the corresponding UX products. Based on them, employers can identify the skills and experiences she has that may be suitable with their qualifications.

   **Content**: Her personal website includes her projects along with their descriptions & images, characters featured in her projects, her basic information (introduction, honors & awards, and skills), and her contact information (Linkedin, Instagram, Email). I think the content addresses the goals of the site's audience extremely well because they can gain many insights about her skills from detailed descriptions of her design process, features of the applications, user feedback, and achievements for each project.

   **What I like**: The content is very well-structured and straightforward; there are clear headings & subheadings and the content is usually accompanied with related images, making it easier for audiences to understand her points. Additionally, she uses her self-designed characters that looks appealling and she sets the contrast, opacity, transparency properties pretty well, which makes her website readable and professional.

   **Audience**:Since she is a high school student, I think the intended audience is the design departments in high school clubs or organizations.

   **Goals of the audience**: They want to view the designs she has made and her flexibility in designing for different fields so that they can determine if she's a suitable applicant.

   **Content**: Her personal website includes her design works for several projects, her introduction, design journey, and contact information. The content addresses the goals because she always briefly introduces the project, demonstrates her design decisions to fit with the theme/goal of each project, and features some of her designs.

   **What I like**: I like how she organizes different designs to their corresponding projects (looks like different files in their corresponding folders) and labels each design with a short description below, which helps the audience follow her contents and stories more easily. Another feature that interests me is a timeline of her design journey; it can show design recruiters of high school clubs her growth and diverse experience in design and leadership.


## Audience
My intended audience is psychology researchers interested in hiring research assistants for their projects.


## Audience Goals
They would want to visit my site because they can learn about my research experiences and skills in psychology, thus determining if I'm suitable to be a part of their project.

The goals that my users have for visiting my website can be:

1. They want to know my research focus and which aspects of psychology I am interested or experienced in.

2. They want to know the skills I have developed through each research project such as skills in statistics, data visualization, literature review.

3. They want to look at the deliverables and outcomes of each project to determine its applicability and my efficiency.


## Audience Reflection

Psychology researchers is a cohesive group of people with uniform goals because they often recruit undergraduates to be research assistants for their studies. From the website, they can determine whether the skills and experiences of the applicant may prove useful to their specific projects.

## Content Justification

Each of my research projects/internships has a different nature so detailing descriptions of the project and my corresponding responsibilities would give better insights into my experiences and skills. The audience will better understand what the purpose of the project is, what I specifically do, what skills I acquire, what knowledge I gain for a particular area of psychology, and what results I deliver. Keywords will reiterate and summarize my skills and knowledge used/gained from each project, and links/images will complement my text descriptions, facilitating the understanding of the audience.
