## CSS Styling Takeaways & Planning

I use <https://www.jackieeworks.com>.

I chose this example website because it is very readable and its minimalist design makes it look professional. The color scheme of it is neutral with a black background and silver/white text. This high contrast ensures easy reading. For the projects' names, such strong contrast along with the big font size and the uppercase also help them capture the attention of the audience. Additionally, the button with a rounded white border and black background draws the audience's attention to it. Its white border provides clear separation from the surrounding elements and the rounded edges give it a softer feel. These highly-visible features prompt the users to click and view her resume. Since I want my audience (psychology researchers) to recognize and pay attention to my headers and easily read the content, using the aforementioned features is a good way to achieve that goal.

I will adopt the high-contrast and big font size for the headings. However, I will use a white background and black/red text because most of the academic-related websites use a white background. Thus, that option would be more universally appealing to researchers. In addition, I won't use a border for a button but for my headline since I want to emphasize it.
