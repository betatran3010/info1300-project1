# Project 1, Milestone 2: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Example Website CSS Property Analysis

For each example website you identified in milestone 1:

1. Include the same screenshot of the example website you included in Milestone 1.
2. Identify 2 parts of the design that you want to analyze for CSS properties.
3. For each part of the design, list the CSS properties for shape, color, and typography that you might use to create a similar design on your personal website.

## CSS Styling Plan
> Pick one of the examples websites to use as inspiration to begin styling your personal website.
> Explain why you chose the example website and how you plan to use it as inspiration for styling your personal website.

I use <https://www.jackieeworks.com>.

I chose this example website because it is very readable and its minimalist design makes it look professional. The color scheme of it is neutral with a black background and silver/white text. This high contrast ensures easy reading. For the projects' names, such strong contrast along with the big font size and the uppercase also help them capture the attention of the audience. Additionally, the button with a rounded white border and black background draws the audience's attention to it. Its white border provides clear separation from the surrounding elements and the rounded edges give it a softer feel. These highly-visible features prompt the users to click and view her resume. Since I want my audience (psychology researchers) to recognize and pay attention to my headers and easily read the content, using the aforementioned features is a good way to achieve that goal.

I will adopt the high-contrast and big font size for the headings. However, I will use a white background and black/red text because most of the academic-related websites use a white background. Thus, that option would be more universally appealing to researchers. In addition, I won't use a border for a button but for my headline since I want to emphasize it.
