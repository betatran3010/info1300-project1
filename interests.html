        <h2> Research Interests </h2>

        <section>
            <h3> Psycholinguistics </h3>
            <p> My fascination with psycholinguistics stemmed from my experience as a coordinator for the Vietnamese Conversation Hour, where I taught Vietnamese to Vietnamese-Americans and students from other ethnicities and countries. They especially struggled with perceiving, listening, and pronouncing the 14 vowel nuclei, 6 tones, and various dialects and accents of Vietnamese. These challenges possibly arise from the differences in cognition and sound production systems apart from upbringings. As for me, I constantly and quite seamlessly alternated between the phonetic features of English and Vietnamese to explain certain words and phrases. Therefore, I thought there might be cognitive changes or adaptations that facilitated such transitions. These insights have fueled my interest in psycholinguistics. </p>

        <section>
            <h3> Memory </h3>
            <p> My country Vietnam is one of the most rapidly aging nations in the world and is also facing an upward trend for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, many AD patients do not receive timely diagnosis and care due to costly medical expenses and lack of public awareness about the disease. The harsh reality faced by AD patients in Vietnam urged me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the biological, psychological, and social factors in memory development and decay throughout the lifespan. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3> Human-Computer Interaction </h3>
            <p> In my independent research about episodic memory decline, I found out that computerized cognitive training programs, video games, and virtual reality can transcend traditional interventions in many ways. They can address ecological validity and transfer effects while still improving episodic memory and other secondary outcome measures. Meanwhile, in my undergraduate research at Cornell, through literature reviews, I also explored studies on cognitive shifts and speech behaviors in interactions between bilingual individuals and virtual avatars. These experiences fueled my interest in human-computer interaction. </p>
