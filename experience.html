                        <li> <em>Overview</em>: Studied the impact of online multiplayer gaming on dialects, speech patterns, and speech behaviors over time. </li>
                        <li> <em>Description</em>: In this lab, I worked under the supervision of Professor Samuel Tilsen and his postdoc Jeremy Needle in the Department of Linguistics. We worked together on a project called "Emergence of Dialects in Networks of Speakers with Random, Constrained Interactions," which was awarded the Cornell New Frontier Grant. Using audio data recorded from participants playing an online map-navigation game, we examined how dialects emerge and speech behaviors evolve over time as a function of people's interactions with one another. </li>

                        <li> <em>Description</em>: In this project, I worked with Professor Shimon Edelman and his Ph.D. student Vivian Zhang. This study aimed to explore whether constant linguistic juggling in bilingualism can potentially complicate the timing of turn-taking compared to monolingualism in infants. To do so, we used recordings of bilingual caregiver-infant conversations to analyze factors such as pause length, utterance initiation speed, and conversation flow to assess potential turn-taking delays. Although I mainly worked on the bilingualism project, I also contributed to the project investigating turn-taking timing in Italian infants with Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. </li>

                            <li> <em>Description</em>: Episodic memory is the type of memory that allows us to consciously recall past personal experiences and events in a determined temporal and spatial context. For people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment, lifestyle and activities of their daily living may be mildly or drastically impacted by the episodic memory decline. While traditional interventions like cognitive training may have proven effective, challenges such as social distancing, mobility issues, and limited healthcare access underscore the need for distance therapy or online-based interventions. The lack of ecological validity in traditional interventions may also require exploring other technological alternatives that improve this limitation. These findings inspired my research project on the effectiveness of technological cognitive-training interventions in slowing AD progression by mitigating the impact of its most prominent impairment—episodic memory decline. In this project, I received mentorship from Dr. Lauren Grant, a Postdoctoral Researcher from the Cognitive Control & Aging Laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis. Through this endeavor, I aspired to explore solutions to proactively augment cognitive function in preclinical or early-stage AD. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> <em>Position</em>: Intern </li>
                        <li> <em>Time</em>: Jun–July 2024 </li>
                        <li> <em>Overview</em>: Shadowed 65 counseling and therapy sessions led by a psychiatrist for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders. </li>
                        <li> <em>Description</em>: Over the summer, I landed an internship with a psychiatrist in one of the largest hospitals in Vietnam. During my internship, I was immersed in a clinical setting where I observed and learned from a psychiatrist's work with patients experiencing a wide range of mental health conditions. I was also exposed to many realistic and diverse clinical cases in terms of age, gender, profession, living situation, and medical condition. Besides gaining knowledge about therapy and medication, I learned that it is necessary to be equipped with external knowledge in many fields, especially new knowledge with high evidentiary value to make it easier to connect with patients. Having such diverse knowledge helps therapists/psychiatrists better understand the patients' situation and experiences as well as help the patients better address the root of their problems. The internship has provided me with insights into a very comprehensive therapeutic process. </li>
                        <li> <em>Responsibilities</em>:
                            <ul>

                                <li> Learned about the prescription of antidepressants and sedatives </li>
                            </ul>
